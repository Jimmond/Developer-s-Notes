# What is Callback Hell?

Callback Hell is a term that refers to the situation where a programmer nests too many callbacks inside each other, resulting in code that is difficult to read and maintain. This problem occurs because asynchronous code based on callbacks quickly becomes complicated and difficult to follow as more and more callbacks are added.

"Callback Hell" usually manifests itself as a block of code with many levels of function nesting, making the code difficult to read and maintain. This is because callbacks can be difficult to track and understand, especially when they are executed in a particular order and are responsible for error handling and other complex tasks.

To solve this problem, it is advisable to use other asynchronous programming techniques, such as promises or async/await, which allow writing asynchronous code in a more readable and maintainable way. However, it is important to note that although these techniques solve the callback nesting problem, they still require a thorough understanding of how asynchronism works in JavaScript to be used effectively.
