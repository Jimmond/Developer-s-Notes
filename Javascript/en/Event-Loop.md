# How does the Event Loop work?

The Event Loop is a crucial part of how JavaScript asynchronism works. It is responsible for managing the queue of tasks and executing them in order.

The Event Loop works as follows:

1. An execution stack (also known as the call stack) is created, which is a data structure that stores the functions to be executed.

2. The main task or "root task" is added to the execution stack.

As long as the execution stack is not empty, the Event Loop extracts the next task from the stack and executes it.

4. If during the execution of a task an asynchronous function is called, this function is not executed immediately, but is added to the task queue.

5. Once the execution stack is empty, the Event Loop checks if there are tasks in the task queue. If there are tasks in the queue, it extracts the next task and adds it to the execution stack to be executed.

6. This process repeats until there are no more tasks in the task queue.

It is important to note that the Event Loop is an infinite loop that runs constantly in the background and allows asynchronous tasks to run in an orderly fashion and in parallel with other tasks. This allows the application to respect the order in which tasks have been added to the task queue and avoids blocking the execution of the program while waiting for the result of an asynchronous operation.
